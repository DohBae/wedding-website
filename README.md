# wedding-website

A website that I've built for my upcoming wedding. It is a single page application which uses JavaScript, React, and SASS.

Guests are able to RSVP to the event, see the schedule for the rehersal dinner and wedding day, browse questions and answers, submit questions to the bride and groom, see the wedding party, and access information for the registry.

To run the website, type npm start for the client and server.
